Hi.

There was a similar plugin only compatible with an older version of Wordpress, 
but I couldn't make it work in the new ones so I had to completely rewrite it.

[Installation]
upload the current_stats folder to your plugins folder
Go to your plugin section in the admin panel and activate it.
Go to Design > Widgets and place the Current Stats widget on the sidebar
*!*!*!*!*!*! chmod 777 hits.txt *!*!*!*!*!*!  if you're dealing with a *nix* based machine *!*!*!*!*!*! 
You might want to report bugs @ flo@dubios.ro . 

[Usage]
You can use these tags in the widget body:
 * %unique%  - as number of unique visitors since 00:00AM
 * %ip%      - as the current visitor's IP
 * %browser% - as the current visitor's browser
 * %os%      - as the current visitor's operatng system
Obviously, you can use html tags, css and whatever.


[Bugs]
Mail me for bugs at flo@dubios.ro! I'll take care of 'em all asap. Thanks in advance.

[Bullshit]
All the current day stats are kept in HITS.TXT. 
The file is automatcally cleared once a day.
Thank you very much for using the plugin. Your readers will come back 
from time to time to simply check your stats, I guarantee.
